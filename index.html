                <h2>Workshop Scope & Topics</h2>
                <div class="scope-content content-block">
                    <p>This half-day workshop aims to bring together researchers and practitioners to advance the modeling, mining, and simulation of human mobility for intelligent transportation systems and urban analytics. As the Internet of Things and smart city infrastructure produce massive, multi-modal mobility datasets, there is both an opportunity and a responsibility: to build scalable, transferable, and privacy-aware models that capture the dynamics of human movement across time, space, and social interaction.</p>
                    
                    <p>We will explore AI-empowered and data-driven methods for modeling human mobility and travel behavior, focusing on how mobility behaviors influence and be influenced by transportation systems. This workshop will examine techniques spanning different levels of resolution—from coarse-grained trip and flow modeling to fine-grained activity chains, trajectories, and agent interactions—supporting diverse applications in planning and operations, such as demand forecasting, policy evaluation, infrastructure planning, anomaly detection, and traffic simulation.</p>
                    
                    <p>This workshop connects the AI, transportation, and geospatial communities to accelerate the development of actionable tools for understanding and simulating human mobility at scale. It invites contributions that address the challenges and opportunities in data fusion, behavioral modeling, real-time analytics, and system-level decision support.</p>
